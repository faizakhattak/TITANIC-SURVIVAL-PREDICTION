# Project Completion: Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective: Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

Dataset: Utilized the Titanic dataset containing information about passengers' age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: Achieved an overall accuracy of 74.3%, indicating that 74.3% of the predictions made by the model are correct.

Precision: For passengers who did not survive (class 0), precision is 73%, and for those who survived (class 1), precision is 78%.

Recall: Identified 90% of passengers who did not survive (class 0) but only 53% of those who survived (class 1).

F1-score: Balanced between precision and recall, with F1-scores of 0.80 for class 0 and 0.63 for class 1.

Support: The number of instances in the test set for class 0 is 105 and for class 1 is 74.

Conclusion:
The model performs better in predicting passengers who did not survive (class 0) compared to those who did survive (class 1). However, there is room for improvement in correctly identifying passengers who survived. Further enhancements and fine-tuning may be explored to improve the model's performance.
